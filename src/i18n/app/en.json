In old-school poker games, you’d sometimes hear her referred to as Calamity Jane, a famous frontierswoman that loved to play 5-card stud."

It is a convenient way to specify that half the jacks should be wild, and as an ancient part of poker slang, it's also just fun to say. One eyed jacks are often paired with the \"Suicide King\" in declaring wild cards."
