      "title": "About TRON",
      "content": "<b>Tron</b> is a decentralized entertainment and content-sharing platform that uses blockchain and peer-to-peer (P2P) technology.<br/><br/><b>Bandwidth</b>: Having TRON bandwidth allows you to perform transactions on the TRON mainnet without paying any gas fees. Having sufficient bandwidth is crucial when using for dApps such as Flipsies.io, where you might want to make several smaller transactions without having to worry about using your TRX tokens in the process. Bandwidth is also used to cement yourself as an active member of the TRON community, allowing you to cast votes for Super Representatives.<br/><br/><b>Energy</b>: This is a special resource used to process smart contracts on the TRON network. Smart contracts consume Energy in addition to Bandwidth, so be sure you have enough of both when moving your tokens around.<br/><br/><b>Freezing</b> is a unique mechanism for the Tron blockchain. You can freeze your TRX in order to gain certain benefits. When you do this, your Tron will still be yours, but you cannot send it anywhere for 3 days. Freezing is similar to putting money onto a saving account: the money is there but you cannot spent it.<br/>When you freeze your TRX, there are several things you can gain.<br/> First you would have to choose if you want to freeze your Tron to gain either <i>Bandwidth points</i> (BP)or <i>Energy Points</i> (EP). On top of this, for each TRX frozen you will get 1 <i>Tron Power</i> - no matter which of the two you choose."
