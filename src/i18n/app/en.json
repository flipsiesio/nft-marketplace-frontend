      "label": "The King of Hearts is usually depicted with a sword, although in the flipsies deck he is armed with a color changing egg. He is typically referred to as the \"suicide king\" because on a traditional deck he is pictured as stabbing himself with a sword, or at least holding a sword behind his head."

      "title": "Man With The Axe",
      "label": "This designation for the King of Diamonds reflects the fact that this is the only king not carrying a sword. That is why he is often referred to as The Man With The Axe. This card is frequently designated as wildcards in home games of draw poker. At the local card game, It was common to hear \"the game is seven card high/low with a buy on the last card. And just to make it more interesting, the man with the axe takes all."

      "title": "Black Widow",
      "label": "The nickname \"Black Widow\" for the Queen of Spades is closely connected with the game of Hearts. In this trick-taking game, the idea is to avoid collecting points, with Hearts cards all worth one point each, while the Queen of Spades costs a massive 13 penalty points. In old-school poker games, youâ€™d sometimes hear her referred to as Calamity Jane, a famous frontierswoman that loved to play 5-card stud."

      "title": "Flower Queen",
      "label": "The Queen of Clubs is known as the \"Queen of flowers\" or the \"Flower Queen\" for an obvious reason - she is usually depicted holding a Flower. Also called the \"Mother Mary\" card or the \"Queen of Queens\" this is also the most speculated card for tarot readings and other psychic beliefs."

    "jackOfDiamonds": {
      "title": "Laughing Boy",
      "label": "Jacks are also called Knaves, and are inferior to the more regal Kings and Queens, making them more playful. The Jack of Diamonds is known as the Laughing Boy, and in some variations of Poker and Black Jack, players are expected to chuckle every time this card is played or drawn."

      "title": "One Eyed Jacks",
      "label": "Unlike most of the other court cards, the Jack of Spades and the Jack of Hearts both have a side profile, hence their designation as \"one-eyed Jacks.\" One eyed jacks is a phrase most often used to describe cards that are being declared wild. It is a convenient way to specify that half the jacks should be wild, and as an ancient part of poker slang, it's also just fun to say. One eyed jacks are often paired with the \"Suicide King\" in declaring wild cards."
